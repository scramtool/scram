Scram is yet-another-scrum-tool.

This PHP/MySQL tool aims to relieve the scrum master from the burden of having to maintain spreadsheets 
with data to create burndown-charts. It does this by enticing team members to fill in their burn-down 
and burn-up data in an online form. In order to do that, the UI is intended to be as responsive and 
intuitive as we can get it. jQuery is used extensively to create fast interactions.

This tool does not intend to replace the task board. Instead, the intention is for team members 
to update their estimates before the daily scrum, so that during the daily scrum people can concentrate
on stories instead of effort estimates.

This tool is far from finished, set up is manual and labor intensive and much configuration is 
still hardcoded.
